The transition strategy from manual to automation-focused testing is structured into three phases, ensuring a smooth adoption while maintaining team collaboration and efficiency. This approach balances automation rollout with continuous team involvement, minimizing disruptions and maximizing long-term success.

**Status Quo**

Understanding the Current Challenges

The current QA process relies heavily on manual testing (90%), leading to:

- Late bug discovery in the release cycle.
- Delayed releases due to last-minute fixes.
- Inconsistent test coverage, increasing risk in production.
- High effort duplication, especially for regression testing.

To improve efficiency and reliability, we need a structured transition from manual to automation-driven testing while ensuring a smooth adoption across teams.


**Proposed Transition Strategy**

Our approach will be incremental, data-driven, and team-centric to ensure long-term success.

**Phase 1: Foundation & Strategy**

1. Assess Current Test Coverage
- Conduct a QA audit to identify critical user journeys and high-risk areas.
- Categorize tests using a Test Automation Feasibility Matrix (i.e., what to automate vs. what remains manual).

2. Selecting the Right Automation Framework
- Proposal: Robot Framework (Python) for UI/API automation due to:
- Ease of adoption (low-code approach beneficial for manual testers).
- Cross-browser and mobile support (Selenium & Appium).
- CI/CD integration with Jenkins or GitHub Actions.

3. A Robust Test Automation Strategy

- Implement the Page Object Model (POM) for maintainability.
- Use data-driven testing with externalized test data in JSON.
- Define test reporting & logging standards (Robot Framework built-in reports + GitHub Actions artifacts)
- Set up a CI/CD pipeline for continuous test execution.( Jenkins Pipeline)

**Phase 2: Automation Development & Early Wins**

Build the automation foundation and show quick results.

1. Automate High-Impact Tests First
- Start with login, registration, and critical flows (Search for property, booking, etc.).
- Cover all user roles (Admin, Agent, Buyer/Seller).

2. Run Automation in Parallel with Manual Testing
- Keep manual testers engaged by involving them in test automation.
- Maintain hybrid execution (run automation in CI/CD while manual testing new features).

3. Handle Resistance & Upskill QA Team
- Conduct hands-on workshops for manual testers.
- Assign mentors to assist in script writing and execution.
- Keep open feedback loops to refine the automation process.

**Phase 3: Full CI/CD Integration & Expansion**

Objective: Make automation a core part of the release cycle.

1.	Expand Test Coverage
- Automate more functional and regression tests.	
- Implement API testing for backend validation.	
- Include cross-browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge) & mobile testing.

2. Enforce Quality Gates in CI/CD
- Add automated tests to pull requests (fail fast).	
- Define go/no-go criteria before production releases.

3. Monitor & Improve Automation	
- Track test execution time, stability, and flakiness.	
- Use test reporting dashboards to visualize automation ROI.
